 - 9/1 & 9/2: researched serial communication and made program in 
              and made a program in CircuitPython to be able to 
              read and write to a file. 
	      (8 hrs)
 - 9/15 & 9/16: researched MIDI to find out if notes can easily be read in it 
		(4 hrs)
 - 9/17: researched MIDI to see how to write a MIDI file and if the bpm could
         be found in the file easily. researched CircuitPython libraries to 
	 see if they could be used to read and write MIDI files 
	 (4 hrs)
 - 9/18: researched libraries to calculate the BPM from a song. uninstalled and 
         reinstalled python a ton because it would not work with installing
         new libraries anymore. found the library aubio to calculate the bpm of a song. 
	 worked with different examples of aubio to figure out how to use it. 
	 (6 hrs)
 - 9/19: researched the Pico hardware to find out if a speaker could be used with it.
         bought a speaker for the Pico. Started to send data serially to 
         the Pico. Figured out what format data had to be in for the Pico to understand
	 it. 
	 (4 hrs)
 - 9/20: got a piezo because the Pico does not have a DAC so I could not use a 
         speaker. Wired up the piezo and used an example to see if it worked. 
	 made the commands to work with the Pico to set, start, and stop the 
         piezo. 
	 (5 hrs)
 - 9/21: made the metronome class to abstract the serial commands for the Pico away
         from the GUI. tested the metronome class thoroughly. 
	 (3 hrs)
 - 9/27: wrote the prior art section of the report. 
	 (.75 hr)
 - 9/28: integrated the metronome into the GUI. created a popup window in the GUI to
	 get the port. wrote all the parts of the report that had to do with the 
         metronome and wrote my part of Empirical Evidence. 
	 (6 hrs)
